# Redux-Project

I have created a project using redux-toolkit and react-redux.
This is my first repository on Github.

New text for second commit
Updated text for second commit to see if the changes are made in main folder in second commit.

I am making some changes in this file by writing the text in the fifth-commit so that we can see some changes in this readme file reflecting in the repo.
